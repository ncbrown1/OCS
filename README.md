# UCSB Object Codes Search

All requests for funds at UCSB must include an object code to describe what the funds will be used for. In most cases, nobody on campus knows which codes they should be using, so they choose to classify their orders as the general, catch-all object code, which is bad for the university as a whole. The benefit of these codes is to track what the university money is being spent on so that efforts can be made to optimize future expenses. If everything is classified as a miscellaneous term, that function cannot be performed and thus, the university will lose money.

Bring forth the Object Codes Search website, which was created in hopes of resolving the issue described above. Essentially, we scraped the UCSB Financial Services web pages for the summaries of each of the object codes and created an index-able model. Using that formatted data, we created a simple web server to serve the HTML and JavaScript that allows users to search for particular object codes using keywords.
